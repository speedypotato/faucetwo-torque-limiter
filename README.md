Consumable proprietary rubber dampeners begone!  Uses a tok tleu1-618-5w torque limiter as tensioning just like a valkyrie knob assembly!

This mod requires:
- 2x tok tleu1-618-5w
- 2x Part1 (3D printed)
- 2x Part2 (3D printed)

Note: The older tok tle1-618-5w is dimensionally shorter and won't work without some modifications.
